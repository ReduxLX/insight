## About The Project
Insight represents the final submission for the FIT3077 Software Architecture unit. \
It is an android app which connects students to tutors namely through a bidding and contract formation process. \
Students post bids on the bid marketplace which describe terms like subject, subject difficulty, rate, schedule and contract length. \
Tutors meanwhile can browse the bid marketplace and either buyout these bids directly or send their own terms (counter-bidding). \
Students can accept the tutor's counter bids instead of waiting for a buyout. \
Once a bid is signed, a contract is formed between the student and tutor for the agreed duration of months.

The above core functionality is further enhanced by the implementation of the following features:
- Private Chatrooms between tutor and student
- Bid Bookmarking system
- Tutor Monitoring Dashboard showing involved and bookmarked bids
- Student Bid Dashboard to review tutor's counter bids
- Contract Renewal & Amendment process for expired contracts
- Notification system for close to expiry contracts
