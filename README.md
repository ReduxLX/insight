## About The Project

For FIT3077 Assignment 2, we have decided to implement our ideas by
creating an android mobile app using Java in Android Studio. 
Our app aims to bring students and tutors together by allowing them
to view, discover, communicate and create contracts.

So far the app contains the following screens: (see app_screenshots folder)
- Login Screen
- Home Screen
- Discovery Screen
- Bids Screen
- Chat Screen
- Profile Screen
